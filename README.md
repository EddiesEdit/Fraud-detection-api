ðŸš€ Fraud Detection API with Real-Time Streaming

An end-to-end machine learning deployment project that exposes a fraud detection model via a FastAPI REST API, containerizes the service using Docker, and integrates real-time streaming using Apache Kafka.

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
You're a machine learning engineer at a fintech startup. Your team has built a fraud detection model and needs to:

âœ… Serve it through a REST API (FastAPI)
âœ… Containerize it for scalability (Docker)
âœ… Stream real-time transaction data (Kafka)
âœ… Make live fraud predictions and return results
âœ… Monitor the system and scale it in production

This project demonstrates a modern MLOps workflow, from model training to real-time serving and streaming.
